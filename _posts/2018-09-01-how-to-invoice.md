Following the contractual payment schedule, we need to send the invoice to the client.

1. **Update the Github issue** with the amount to be invoiced. Make sure to outline the need or not for Chinese invoice (fapiao).
2. **Assign to the Ops team** and specifically to the relevant team member for the country the invoice need to be emitted from.
3. **Ops team will prepare the invoice** and relevant information shared back (*e.g.* delivery number, date sent, etc.) and follow with the client.

**Note:**

* Our basic payment schedule is N45 (paid under 45 days)
