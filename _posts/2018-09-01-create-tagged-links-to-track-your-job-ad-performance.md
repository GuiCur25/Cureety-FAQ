The general idea is to tag links which drive people on Wiredcraft.com through job ads.
By doing so, you can get relevant metrics such as unique pageviews, conversion rate, bounce rate.

Below is the step-by-step procedure to do so:

1. Go on the URL builder tool provided by Google: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en)
2. Fill the fields as follow:
* **Website URL**: should be the job description on Wiredcraft.com (ex.:https://wiredcraft.com/jobs/mobile-developer/)
* **Campaign Source**: the website where the job has been published (ex.:Lagou, V2EX, LinkedIn)
* **Campaign Medium**: the type of website on which the job has been published (ex.:job platform, social network)
* **Campaign Term**: leave it blank as it's not paid ads
* **Campaign Content**: this field is to evaluate several versions of the same text while being on the same job portal and using the same job ad on Wiredcraft.com (ex:1.0)
* **Campaign Name**: this field is for the job title (ex.: Mobile Developer)
3. Click on Generate URL and copy it
4. Go on [https://bitly.com/](https://bitly.com/) and minimize your URL
5. Replace the original link (https://wiredcraft.com/jobs/mobile-developer/) by the tag rich link (https://wiredcraft.com/jobs/mobile-developer/?utm_source=Lagou&utm_medium=job%20platform&utm_content=1.0&utm_campaign=Mobile%20Developer)
