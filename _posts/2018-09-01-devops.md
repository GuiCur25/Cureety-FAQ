**[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is nothing more than [agile principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) applied to the interface between software and infrastructure**.

The goal is to accelerate development, improve quality and lessen the stress on the team. We apply a wide range of methodologies and tools, most of them revolving around the following values;

- **Open**; Ops and Dev people work as a team from the beginning of the project. Information is transparently shared across the team (e.g. Slack notifications on commits and code deployment), incidents are openly addressed as a team ([5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) & [After Action Rerport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_action_report)).
- **Iterative**; we release and deliver in small increments of changes as quickly as possible. This heavily relies on automation (e.g. Ansible) and continuous everything (e.g. TravisCI, Pipelines).

## Best-practices & Toolbox

- **Monitoring, Logging & Reporting**; we monitor, log and report everything we can with [TIGK](https://www.influxdata.com/products/) (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana & Kapacitor) and [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products) (ElasticSearch, Logstash & Kibana). We also log errors happening in the clients (React, iOS, Android...) with [Sentry](http://sentry.io) or [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/).
- **Configuration management & Infrastructure as code**; we scripts everything we can, from deployment pipelines to infrastructure configuration with Python and [Ansible](http://ansible.com).
- **Micro-services and Containers**; [we tend to prefer building SOA](playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/loosely-coupled-tightly-aligned/)<sup>1</sup> with lots of small (often state-less) micro-services. We increasingly rely on [Docker](http://docker.com) to deliver these services.
- **[Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Continuous testing**; we try and test most things (including things like Ansible playbooks) and continuously run/report these tests in Slack with tools like TravisCI.
- **Testing, Performance & Scalability**; we continuously monitor code benchmarks (e.g. memory usage), run and report tests (even for Ansible) and stress-test services before releasing (using [Locust](http://locust.io/), [ApacheBench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) or [Siege](https://github.com/JoeDog/siege)).
- **ChatOps**; we over-communicate all development related events in Slack (from commits on GitHub to monitoring failures and deployment status). When possible, we allow users to run commands from Slack using a bot (aka [ChatOps](https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github)).
- **[Just-in-time engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing)**; we avoid premature optimization (e.g. caching) or over-engineering.
- **5 Whys & AAR**; following an incident, the team gets together and investigate the root cause of the issue using the [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique. We often send a [AAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_action_report) to stakeholders and/or clients afterwards. We're not looking for a culprit, we're using this as an opportunity to learn and grow.
