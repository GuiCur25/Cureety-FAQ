When designing software, we refer to 2 main activities;

- **User Experience (UX) is about how things work**. It is usually associated with a collection of user-centric activities; user research, user flows, information architecture, wireframes... Its goal usually is about making things easy and intuitive for the end-user.
- **User Interface (UI) is about how things look**. It can overlap with some of the UX activities (e.g. wireframes), but is often more focused on wireframes, mockups, front-end code... The goal often is to define a consistent and pleasing visual "language" for users.

These activities usually run alongside through the whole project; UX and UI are rarely "done" (but so is software). They revolve around one of these tools/deliverables;

- **User flow, Wireframes & Mockups**; user flows and wireframes are probably the most ubiquitous tools for us. We almost exclusively design them with paper. We usually create mockups and final assets with [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) and share them as interactive prototypes with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). We sometimes augment these tools with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere & Quartz Composer for specific needs (branding and video montage).
- **[User & Stakeholder Interviews](https://hackpad.com/Interviews-Jqm1k2OoJbn)**; we run interviews with users and the project stakeholders to better understand the context of how the software is used, and its purpose. You can refer to the ["Understand" phase of our product design process](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#understand).
- **User data; surveys, analytics, user testing...**; these are typically preformed when the project has already been launched. Analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) are usually a must.
- **User personas**; user personas are a great way to improve the team's understanding of the users they're designing for, and help us empathize with them.
- **A/B tests**; we try and take as much of our design decisions with data. A/B tests are a great way to evaluate which of our variants (*see ["Diverging"](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#diverge) in our product design process*) perform better.
