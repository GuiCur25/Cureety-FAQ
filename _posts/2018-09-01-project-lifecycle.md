Following on the [Product design](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/product-design/), the products goes through the following 3 steps:

1. **Kick-off**: through an initial meeting we solidify a common understanding of the work which leads to: a refined strategy, fleshed out [personas, core user stories]http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/user-story/) and tasks.
3. **Iterative development**: we follow [Scrumban methodology](https://blog.assembla.com/AssemblaBlog/tabid/12618/bid/87904/Scrum-Kanban-ScrumBan-an-Easy-Scrum-Upgrade.aspx) which allows us to avoid *big design up front* in favor of *planning on demand*. We deliveries subset of issues (previously agreed on) during sprints which are organized in milestones.
4. **Conclusion**: following the succesful delivery of the deliverables we conduct a post-mortem meeting. All team members are invited to retrospect on the past project. The goal is to improve future iterations and highlight lessons learned.

* Check-in regularly
* Team members doing the work support the effort (bottom-up approach)
* Call ad-hoc meetings when necessary
* Host weekly stand up with all team members (in person or online)

**Do not**
