- **Job ads**: open positions are all [advertised on the website](https://wiredcraft.com/about/#jobs). If your team needs to recruit a profile that is not advertised there, talk to your team and [add a new job ad on the website](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/marketing/tree/master/_jobs). Make sure you understand [how to write a job ad](/article/where-to-post-job-ads) beforehand.
- **Recruitment priorities**: we usually set recruitment priorities based on capacity planning. Let your team leader know if you think a certain profile should be a priority.
- **Advertisement**: job ads (especially prioritised ones) are posted on multiple channels; social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, WeChat), newsletter, job platforms (e.g. Lagou), communities (e.g. V2EX, Hacker News)... You can read more about **[where we post which job ads and why](/article/where-to-post-job-ads)**.
- **Applications**: we receive applications through multiple channels:
  - **Form on the site** (e.g. [apply to the front-end developer position](https://wiredcraft.com/jobs/front-end-developer/#application)) or **email to job@wiredcraft.com or jobs@wiredcraft.com**. This automatically creates an issue in [the recruitment repo](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/recruitment) and sends an email to the candidate.
  - **From 3<sup>rd</sup> parties** (e.g. Lagou). For these, the perations team takes care of manually creating issues on GitHub.
  - **Personal networks**. Members of the team often either refer or get contacted by potential recruits. Manually add an entry in [the recruitment repo](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/recruitment) when this happens.
- **Applications review**: as previously mentioned, all applications are tracked in [`Wiredcraft/recruitment`, the recruitment repo](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/recruitment). This provides the opportunity for anybody on the team to evaluate and comment on applications.
- **Screening calls & Interviews**: for interesting candidates, we often recommend to do a first 15 minutes screening call to assess if it's worth moving to a face to face interview. Feel free to skip this step if you feel the candidate is interesting enough.
- **Interviews**: we try and do face to face interviews whenever possible, and video otherwise. These are usually run by the team leader. They're usually divided in 3 parts (read [the how-to if you need to interview a candidate](/article/how-to-interview-a-candidate)):
  - **First a 20 minutes discussion** to evaluate the candidate's experience, skills and fit (~20 minutes)
  - **Then a 10 minutes Q&A** for the candidate to ask questions about the position, company...
  - **Finally, we give the candidate a test**. If possible, this is done on-site (~60 minutes), otherwise sent online.
- **Offers**: based on the results of the interview and test, we may decide to make an offer. We use a standard salary table to begin salary negotiations. Offers are validated by operations and the team leader before they're sent out.
