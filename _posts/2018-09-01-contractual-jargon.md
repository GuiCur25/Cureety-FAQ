A contractual lexicon.

## Contractual documents

The contract flow can be seen as such:

![Contract flow](http://techproductmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ContractsFlow.jpg)

* **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)**  
Before signing a contract, a NDA (Non-Disclosure-Agreement) is needed in most cases in order to save both sides interests.

* **MSA (Master Service Agreement)**  
Defines how the two companies will do business together.

* **SOW (Statement of Work)**  
Describes the work to be performed for the client. Note that the MSA defines the “how” and the SOW defines the “what” of the work.

* **CO (Change Order)**  
Change Orders document any changes in scope, budget, timeline, assumptions or any other deviation from the current SOW.

* **PR/PO (Purchase Request/Purchase Order)**  
Usually for bigger companies - in this case in most cases no MSA or SOW needed
