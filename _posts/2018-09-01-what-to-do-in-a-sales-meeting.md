1. **Shut up and let the client talk**. Your goal is to make him tell you as much about himself, his organization and his problems. Which means you need to...
1. **Ask questions**. Lead the client gently toward a conversation about how your services can provide benefit
1. **Pay attention and take notes**. Show investment in the conversation and the client's time. Also, you never know what you might forget!
1. **Follow up immediately after the meeting**. As soon as possible, get an email out thanking the client for her/his time, recapping what was covered, and laying out next steps for both parties. This demonstrates a lot of value to prospective clients.
