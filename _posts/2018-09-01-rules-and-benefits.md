**We treat our colleagues as adults**.

This means that sometimes team members bend the rules, but we expect them to do so in a respectful and mature way. Use company
resources and privileges the same way you would use yours. Behave with others the same way you would with family members.

Some of the main rules and benefits for our teammates<sup>1</sup>;

- **We work between 9:30 AM and 6:30 PM** but allow for a lot of flexibility. We do recommend that you show before 11:00 AM
  though to make sure you have some overlap with those of us who start early. We're spread over China, Europe and sometimes
  the USA, so be mindful of other people's schedules.
- **Days off & Holidays**; try and give us a heads up at least a week in advance so that we can plan for it (unless it's an emergency).
  We usually submit our request on the team's calendar and mention it to our colleagues and/or team leader for approval.
- **Sick days & WFH (Work From Home)**; if you need (or want) to work from home for the day, simply give us a heads up on Slack/WeChat.
  Try and do so before work starts (9:30 AM) and make sure your team leader is in the loop.
- **Remote work**; in some cases we allow colleagues to work remotely for a certain period of time (e.g. working from your
  hometown or another office for a few weeks). This is usually granted by your team leader on a per-case basis.
- **Raises & Bonuses**; you can [read more about OKRs and performance reviews](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/growth-performances-and-raises/) and
  how they relate to your compensation. We consider raises every 6 months, provide a 13th month at the end of the year and award cash
  or non-cash rewards/bonuses on a per-case basis.
- **Transparency**. Disclose information that may be relevant to the team; personal relationships with clients and colleagues, past professional collaborations...
- **Non-compete**; while you may have side projects going on, we ask that you do not work for direct competitors and that
  you avoid committing to projects that affect your performances at work.
- **Privacy**; whether it's about our clients or your colleagues, we assume you'll be discrete about most things and especially careful with sensitive data
  (e.g. voter data for the elections of Myanmar).
- **Reimbursements**; it's often more convenient for us to reimburse certain expenses (e.g. ticket for a conference) after your purchased it. Just 
  make sure to check with your team leader first. If you can't cover the price, just create an issue in the appropriate repo (often the
  [team repo](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/team)) or follow the [reimbursement steps](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/expenses-reimbursement/).
- **Perks**; we have free lunches on Fridays, company off-sites, team building events, snacks at the office, ... Teams also have their
  own budgets to purchase useful resources (e.g. books, software licenses, media, gear). Ask your team leader.

If you still don't have your answer, chances are that you're not the only one. Try one of the following;

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/team/issues/new?body=Make+sure+to+select+the+question+label) and we'll try to add it to the
  playbook. 
- Ask your team leader or a member of the operations team. You can also drop a line to all leaders using your company email: [leadership@wiredcraft.com](mailto:leadership@wiredcraft.com.com).
- Shoot an email to our CEO or reach out to him on Slack. If you want your feedback to be anonymous, just use the [anonymous feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/xmTOMXDMrvFIDNud2).

We can't satisfy every request, but we do listen, so don't hesitate to let us know what you think or need.
