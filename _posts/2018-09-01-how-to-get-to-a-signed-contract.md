title: How to get to a signed contract?
category: Business
---

When we win a project (see [our sales workflow](http://playbook.wiredcraft.com/article/our-sales-workflow/)), we usually prepare a contract (although larger clients often have their own SOW or consulting agreement template).

Preparing a contract is pretty straightforward once you have the estimate done;

1. **Gather the legal details from the client** (you can use [the Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sh4hYsdE5zEMvrH_RDab0fKb3iSUyCFmgDQbv7Clz5Q/viewform) for that<sup>1</sup>). This includes;
  - The full legal name of the client's organization,
  - The full legal address of the client's organization,
  - The name and contact info (phone number & email address) of the client's point of contact,
  - The name of the client's signee.
1. **Copy the [contract template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-f9Fqpjf4evghr2Et9Sj1-sSaCN_M4tYLXsj1NdMkk/edit#)**, or alternatively the template from the client, from Google Docs into the proper folder (`WCL Business › Projects › CLIENT_NAME`). The file should be name something like `Wiredcraft-CLIENT_NAME-PROJECT_NAME`.
1. **Fill it in** with both the legal details and the content from the estimate (see annotation highlighted in yellow throughout the template).
1. **Submit the contract to the client**. If possible use [HelloSign](http://hellosign.com) to get it signed (you can also share it as a PDF or a view-only Google Doc otherwise).
1. **Prepare invoicing**. Once the client has signed the contract, prepare and schedule all the invoices based on the payment schedule (we use [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/)).

Note that if the client is asking for any kind of modification of our contract template, this need to be reviewed and analyzed by a more senior team member.
