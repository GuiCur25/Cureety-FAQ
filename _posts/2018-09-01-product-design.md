**[Our product design process](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/) helps us improve the odds of [making something people want](http://paulgraham.com/good.html) by focusing on the idea/validation feedback loop**. We apply this process to most of what we do; it helps us design marketing experiments, write business proposals, shape our company strategy...

We took inspiration from [Google Ventures' Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/), going iteratively through 5 steps;

- **[Understand](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#understand)**: establish the context and problem (e.g. "What data do we have?", "What pain are we solving?"), list our assumptions and define how we intend to validate them.
- **[Diverge](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#diverge)**: generate multiple (potentially conflictual) solutions to solve the problem at hand.
- **[Converge](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#converge)**: align the team around one approach (e.g. a single user flow/storyboard).
- **[Prototype](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#prototype)**: quickly build a prototype we can test.
- **[Validate](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/#validate)**: test the prototype, usually with actual users outside of our team, to learn what works and what doesnâ€™t.

Each cycle helps us validate and invalidate our assumptions, and get us one step closer to understanding what works.
