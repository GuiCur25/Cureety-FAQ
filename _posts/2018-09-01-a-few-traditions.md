- **If something breaks, it's the latest hire's fault**. We like to jokingly blame our latest recruit for things that are obviously not their fault.
- **We have a monthly team building**. The whole team usually takes a Friday afternoon to go enjoy an activity (e.g. karting, bowling, archery) and then have dinner together. We also have larger dinners for special occasions (e.g. Christmas, Chinese New Year).
- **We have a weekly team lunch on Friday**, sometimes with a presentation from one of the team members (although [this is still being discussed right now](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/wiredcraft.github.io/issues/2244#issuecomment-187641759)).
- **We have a company off-site at least once a year**. In previous years, we've sent the team to Moganshan, Berlin and Prague. This is usually a time to work on side projects, relax and get closer.
