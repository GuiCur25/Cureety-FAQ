To ensure the success of projects we follow 4 core concepts:

1. **Transparency**: the clients and team members all have access to the [same information](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/playbook/wiki/Working-with-your-colleagues) and the same communication channels (*e.g.* Github, Slack, Hackpad).
2. **Traceability**: all actions are clearly outlined and tracked online most likely [Github](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/github-for-everything/) (*e.g.* meeting next steps, migrating emails discussions to issues, actionable discussions from Slack).
2. **Accountability**: team members and clients are accountable for their respective actionables.
4. **Rational, not emotional**: make decisions based on the realities of the situation, not on reaction to emotions ([learn to respond, not react](https://zenhabits.net/respond/)).

**Leading by example** and **enforcing** these concepts is paramount for the project manager and benefits the team members at large.

A few other concepts to keep in mind:

* Always under promise and over deliver
* Prototype fast
* Deliver in small incremental batches
