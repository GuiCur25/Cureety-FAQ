title: Retrospective and continuous learning
category: Projects
---

At the end of each sprint the team is conducting a retrospective to know what to:

1. **Continue doing**
2. **Stop doing**
3. **Try doing**

This can be covered with the questions:

* What was supposed to happen?
* What actually happened?
* What worked really well during this project?
* What should we make sure we do again in the future?
* Where did we run into challenges?

Make sure you outline actionables and discuss with the team how to implement them to foster continuous learning.

### Dos and don’ts
**Definitely do**

* Emphasiye the need for continuous improvement (processes are not set in stone)
* Learn from history
* Take action
* Add it in your project plan
* Be honnest and constructive
* Keep track of past retrospectives

**Do not**

* Point fingers
* Use the occasion to vent
* Considering the retrospective a “post-mortem” or “after-action” report rather than an opportunity to plan for improvement
* Suppress feelings
* Include uninvited external members (team only unless invited)
