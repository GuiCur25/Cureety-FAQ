title: Internal marketing strategy
category: Marketing
---

Our marketing strategy is overall simple and aligned with [our business approach](/article/sales-101/): being **genuine, helpful and trustworthy**.

We're are a digital product agency. We create digital solutions for the largest brands in the world (with a special focus on luxury, retail and FMCG).

That includes things like customer loyalty platforms (WeChat, mobile, web), new retail solutions (O2O installations), AI for customer insights...

## Tone

Whether we talk at an event, speak to a client or write a post, our tone is consistent:

- **Confident & Knowledgeable**; we know what we're talking about and are confident in our opinions and expertise.
- **Upfront & Transparent**; we say it how it is and share as much as we can with the rest of the world<sup>1</sup>.
- **Witty & Approachable**; we're sometimes cheeky and make sure people know they can reach out.

<small>1: This means we sometimes share things that would make others uncomfortable, like sharing our entire way of running our company through this playbook.</small>

## Keywords/Topics

- **Primary**: Agency, Solutions, Product, Digital, Design, Innovation, Enterprise, Loyalty, Retail, FMCG, Luxury, WeChat.

## Mediums

- **Content**; the most important element of our marketing plan; blog posts and videos (from events). We occasionally get others to write about us (e.g. [TIA Article](http://www.topinteractiveagencies.com/digital/agency/profiles/leadership-style-extreme-minimalism/)).
- **Events**; monthly meetups (e.g. [Shanghai UI/UX](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-UI-UX-Designers-Meetup/)) and yearly conferences (e.g. [JSConf China](http://jsconf.cn)). We also participate to and speak at other events (e.g. Barcamp).
- **Newsletters**; we collect email addresses through our blog, events and business development. We reach out to these mailing lists regularly (at least once a month).
- **Social media**; we broadcast our content and events on various social media, with a special focus on WeChat, LinkedIn and Facebook.

## Schedule

**[We track all of the content and events (whether ours or others') in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PDNj1Q1pRSjqEYc_-PMEQQWM5gMgB4rDrDRXZEIokLg/edit#gid=1770647921)**.

The schdule goes roughly as follows;

- **At least 1 blog post per week**; this excludes "fluff posts" (e.g. new team member joining or upcoming event).
- **2 to 4 meetups per month**; UI/UX (every month in both Berlin and Shanghai), Hacker News (every month in Shanghai), JS meetup (once every two months in Shanghai) and occasionally a few others (DevOps, Ansible, Docker...).
- **2 to 3 newsletters a month**; a personal email from our CEO every couple weeks (includes some insights about a single topic and usually a link to one of our posts) and a summary of the past month (collection of posts from us and others).
- **A WeChat post every week**; which usually points to our latest blog post/case study/event.
- **Posting new content on LinkedIn and Facebook regularly**, either new posts/events/case studies or older popular entries. We cross-post our blog posts on LinkedIn.
