The project goes through several sprints iterations which will follow the common structure.

### How to plan sprints

Each sprint should start with the following.

1. Discuss and set a **goal**
2. Review and Assign **user story**
3. Estimate the fitting **effort**
4. Assign issues to a specific **milestone**

### Sprints meetings

The following meetings take place during the sprints.

* **Sprint planning**: kicking off the sprint(s).
* **Daily stand-up**: general daily status meeting (details are discussed outside of this meeting).
* **Sprint review**: showcase the work of the team through a demo and celebrate accomplishments
* **Post mortem**: understand what worked well and what did not.

### How to properly kick-off (Sprint 0)

The kick-off sprint will prepare the upcoming developments.

* **Everybody** should attend
* Present the **personas** and **user story**
* Define the **product backlog** which will list most if not all of the tasks for the upcoming issues
* Define clearly the **goals**
* Schedule the **milestones**
* Outline the **roles**
	* *Product backlog*: the main owner of the product
	* *Scrum master*: handling scrums and keep things on track
	* *Development team*: outline skills of each

### Dos and donâ€™ts
**Definitely do**

* Keep the sprints duration consistent
* Always focus on the current sprint planning
* Outline low hanging fruits for each sprint
* Plan with some leeway (add unplanned time and corporate overhead)
* Allow team members to make decisions

**Do not**

* Plan all sprints ahead
* Add additional taks in an ongoing sprint
* Do not schedule a milestone to finish on a Thursday or Friday (avoid weekend support)
* Do not skip daily stand-up meetings
* Make estimates or commitments on team's behalf
