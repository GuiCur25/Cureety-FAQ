title: Contract numbering scheme
category: Business

In order to keep the overview over our contracts and  being able to consolidate them across different platforms, we are implementing the following contracting scheme.

### How do we name and number the contracts?

We are following this pattern:

`Location - Client Name - Opportunity - Type of Contract - Date [YYMMDD]`
 
For example:

`S-BASF-3-SOW-170626`

Which means:

* `S` - Contract for Shanghai
* `BASF` - The client is BASF
* `1` - Third contract with the client
* `SOW` - This is a SOW document
* `170626` - It was signed on the 26 of June 2017

See below for more information on each item.

### Numbering items

1. Location

Acronym | Definition
---- | ----
S | Shanghai
G | Global
B | Berlin

2. Client Name
3. Opportunity number
4. Contract naming

Acronym | Definition
----- | -----
NDA | Non Disclosure agreement
MSA | Master Service Agreement
SOW | Statement of Work
CO | Change Order

5. Date (date of signature of client) - Format `YYMMDD`
 
### Where do we add the contract number?

We need to have a contract number scheme on all related tools and documents:

* Wave - add in contract number field
* Google docs- contract number in footer
* Github issue - contract number in title
