## What is a reimbursement

Overall, our approach for these  is the same as everything else; we assume you behave responsibly and expect you handle company expenses in the same way you would with your own money.

Here are few guidelines;

- **For any expense, you have to provide a fapiao (for China) or official invoice**. Reach out to operations; see below for the reimbursement steps.
- **Small related expenses** (e.g. cab ride) are systematically reimbursed, assuming they're in a reasonable range (maximum of 200 RMB/30 USD/30 EUR).
- **Larger expenses** (e.g. business trip to another city, conference tickets for multiple team members) require confirmation from your team leader. Create an issue in the appropriate repo (e.g. `Wiredcraft/business` for a business trip or `Wiredcraft/team` for a conference) with the estimated budget and assign it to him.
- **Team leaders have access to a discretionary budget** for their department they can use for things like team lunches, books, online courses. Larger expenses (above 600 RMB/100 USD/100 EUR) need approval from the Operations team.
- **Always ask your team leader if you think the company should reimburse something**. Often, the reason why we haven't offered to cover an expense is just that we're not aware of it.

## Reimbursement steps

In order to get a reimbursement you need to follow these steps:

* **Step 1**: request the official fapiao(s) (physical and digital are both acceptable) related to the expense.
* **Step 2**: fill out the [reimbursement form](https://goo.gl/forms/FHczq6zs1hpCuw303).
* **Step 3**: submit the fapiao(s) to the Operations team.

**You'll be reimbursed at the end of the month along with the payroll**. If you need to be reimbursed before that, mention it in the comment section of the reimbursement form.
