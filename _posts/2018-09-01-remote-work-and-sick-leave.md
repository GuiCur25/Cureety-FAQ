As with everything else, we assume our team members behave responsibly. We do however ask that you submit a request in [Brease](http://brease.io/)<sup>1</sup> to keep track of the following things;

- **Work from home**; if you want to spend a day working outside of the office. Remember that things are a lot easier when the team can meet face to face (e.g. SCRUM). Try to not to exceed max. 10 days / month.

- **Remote work**; if you plan on spending more than 2 consecutive days outside of the office, you'll need approval from your team leader. We allow certain employees to be full time remote<sup>2</sup>, this is however on a case per case basis. If you want to move out of our main locations but still want to work remotely with us, just tallk to your team leader. When you're working remotely, make sure you have a reliable connection, that you're connected on Slack at all times and that you join SCRUM meetings and other discussions or meetings. We expect you to be proactive if you're stuck or if you're not assigned to any task.
- **Sick leave**; if you're sick or feeling unwell, add a request on brease.io and make sure your team is aware of it. Don't forget to also let the Operations team and your manager know, what the expected duration of your absence will be.

Regulation for the German office:
A doctorsâ€™ certificate must be handed in latest on the third day of sickness / absence.
Example:
If you get sick on a Monday, you need to have a sick leave certificate on Wednesday; if you get sick on a Thursday,           then you have time to hand it in until Monday.


<small>1: Log in Brease with your Slack account. Brease is developed internally at Wiredcraft, so let us know in #brease on Slack if we can improve it.</small>

<small>2: For remote workers, we usually insist on having them coming into the office at least once a month when possible, especially for team buildings.</small>
