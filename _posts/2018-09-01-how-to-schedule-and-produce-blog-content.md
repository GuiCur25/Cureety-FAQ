[Blog posts are at the core of our marketing strategy](/Several-mediums); they're the main asset driving traffic to our website and a key element when pitching clients. Getting a consistent stream of blog posts from our creatives and developers is very challenging, but crucial to our activity.

We host weekly editorial meetings as a marketing team to coordinate our posts and ensure the process is moving smoothly.


- We keep a [schedule of upcoming blog posts in a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TSeMy2K2HKRB_GkKQqXQogH8I0Pt_5VPeBkBlrt5qhg/edit?usp=sharing) and rigorously map things out in advance.
- Then we spend some time building a list of interesting topics well in advance to map out a good variety for publishing.
- Finding contributors is next. The trick here is finding colleagues who have done work relevant to the topic and are interested in sharing their thoughts and experience.
- At every meeting, we'll follow this **agenda:**
  - _For that week (1 week before posting):_ making sure posts are ready, scheduling last touches/polish and scheduling the sharing/PR/outreach campaign (for example, if we mention a 3rd party, maybe reach out to them).
  - _For the next week (2 weeks before posting):_ checking on progress and making sure we'll meet the deadline. Potentially figure out who on the team needs/can help.
  - _For the week after (3 weeks before posting):_ picking a topic and identifying people on the team to be contributors.
