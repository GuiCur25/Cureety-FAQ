Any sale will go through a portion of the following pipeline;

1. **Prospect**; a prospect is a contact that may have a project for us. It may come referred from a friend or someone who came to us.
1. **Lead**; once we've established that there is indeed a project opportunity, we refer to it as a lead. Most of the time we skip the "prospect" stage since we get contacted directly about our services or a specific project.
1. **Qualified**; if a need is a fit for us (goal, technology, resources, timeline), we move a lead to "qualified" and finish collecting all the information we need from the client to prepare an estimate.
1. **Negotiating**; once the client received the estimate, we often negotiate terms (price, scope, timeline).
1. **Won** or **Lost/Rejected**; either we come to an agreement with the client or we don't. Whether it's because the client refuses our terms ("Lost") or because we decide it isn't a fit ("Rejected").
1. **Revisit**; prospects or leads are sometimes delayed

We use mainly two tools through this pipeline;

- [Streak](https://www.streak.com/) to track connections (people we're introduced to or meet) and potential leads directly in Gmail. It's particularly useful to share email threads without CC'ing a ton of people (and track if people have opened your emails).
- The [GitHub sales repo](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/sales) where we coordinate the work on estimates. An issue is created automatically if the lead is using [our online form](https://wiredcraft.typeform.com/to/GG4GQz). It helps facilitating the work on an estimate with the rest of the team for a qualified lead.

To summarize:

1. Track your connections through the Streak "Connections" pipeline.
1. Track leads through the Streak "Sales" pipeline.
1. To get an estimate, coordinate with the team on GitHub.
